# Job-Application-Tracker
Provides a form for entries of Companies that I've applied for. Keeps track of Company Name, date applied, a link to either the job posting/ company website, and some key notes. It then adds them to my MySQL database and displays a list of all the entries. I know there's going to unfortunately be a lot of entries ;[
